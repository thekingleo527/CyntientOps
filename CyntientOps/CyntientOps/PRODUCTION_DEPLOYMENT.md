# CyntientOps v7.0 - Production Deployment Guide

🚀 **Complete Production Deployment Documentation**

## Overview

CyntientOps is a comprehensive building operations management system with real-time NYC API integration, worker coordination, and intelligent building maintenance tracking.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **ServiceContainer**: Dependency injection and service orchestration
- **BBLGenerationService**: NYC property data integration via BBL (Borough-Block-Lot) identifiers
- **GRDBManager**: SQLite database management with GRDB.swift
- **OperationalDataManager**: Real-world operational data coordination
- **NovaAIManager**: AI-powered operational intelligence

### NYC API Integration
- **HPD Violations**: Housing Preservation & Development violations
- **DOB Violations**: Department of Buildings violations  
- **DOF Assessment**: Department of Finance property assessments
- **DSNY Violations**: Department of Sanitation violations
- **Geoclient API**: BBL generation and address geocoding

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Prerequisites
1. **Xcode 15.0+** with iOS 17.0+ deployment target
2. **NYC Open Data App Token**: Increases rate limits from 1,000 to 50,000 requests/day
3. **NYC Geoclient API Credentials**: For BBL generation and geocoding
4. **Network connectivity** to NYC Open Data APIs

### Step 1: Configuration Validation

```bash
# Run configuration validator
cd /Volumes/FastSSD/Xcode/CyntientOps/CyntientOps
swift Scripts/ProductionConfigValidator.swift
```

This validates:
- ✅ API keys and credentials
- ✅ Network connectivity to NYC APIs
- ✅ Database configuration
- ✅ Security settings
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Worker-building assignments

### Step 2: Production Deployment

```bash
# Execute full production deployment
swift Scripts/ProductionDeploymentFinal.swift
```

This process includes:
- **Phase 1**: Dependency verification
- **Phase 2**: Database initialization and schema migration
- **Phase 3**: NYC property data generation for all buildings
- **Phase 4**: User account seeding and client relationships
- **Phase 5**: API connection validation
- **Phase 6**: Final production readiness check

### Step 3: Building Data Generation

The deployment automatically generates comprehensive NYC property data:

```swift
// Generated for each building:
- BBL (Borough-Block-Lot) identifier
- Market value and assessed value
- Tax payment history
- Active violations (HPD, DOB, DSNY)
- Local Law compliance (LL97, LL11, LL87)
- Property financial data
```

let dbManager = GRDBManager.shared
print("Database connected: \(dbManager.isConnected)")
```

**Service Container Errors**
```swift
// Verify service health
let health = serviceContainer.getServiceHealth()
