# CyntientOps Production Dashboard Status

## ‚úÖ AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM - PRODUCTION READY

### Unified Authentication
- **Single Source**: All authentication flows through `NewAuthManager`
- **Security**: SHA256 password hashing with unique salts
- **Session Management**: Secure token-based sessions with expiration
- **Biometric Support**: Face ID/Touch ID integration ready
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin, client, worker, and manager roles

### Legacy Code Removal
- ‚úÖ Removed old `GRDBManager.authenticateWorker()` plain text method
- ‚úÖ Eliminated duplicate authentication methods
- ‚úÖ Created `UnifiedAuthenticationService` as single entry point
- ‚úÖ All authentication now uses secure hashing throughout

## ‚úÖ CLIENT DASHBOARD - PORTFOLIO FILTERING VERIFIED

### Data Filtering (`ClientDashboardViewModel`)
- **Line 143-167**: `loadClientData()` filters buildings by client email
- **Line 300-305**: Tasks filtered to client's buildings only  
- **Line 368-372**: Intelligence insights filtered to client buildings
- **Line 605-606**: Dashboard updates only for client's buildings
- **Line 659-677**: Photo evidence filtered by client buildings

### Navigation System
- **Sheet-based Navigation**: Proper state management with `ClientRoute` enum
- **Building Details**: `sheet = .buildingDetail(building.id)` (Lines 132, 171)
- **Compliance Screen**: `sheet = .compliance` (Lines 162, 183)
- **Profile/Chat**: Working buttons with proper routing (Lines 395, 425)

### Real-World Data Integration
```swift
// Client buildings filtered by organization
let clientData = try await container.client.getClientForUser(email: currentUser.email)
let clientBuildingIds = try await container.client.getBuildingsForClient(clientData.id)

// Only show client's buildings
let filteredBuildings = allBuildings.filter { buildingIds.contains($0.id) }
```

## ‚úÖ WORKER DASHBOARD - ROUTINES & SCHEDULES VERIFIED

### Task Loading (`WorkerDashboardViewModel`)
- **Line 1431-1476**: `loadTodaysTasks()` loads worker-specific assignments
- **Line 1436**: Gets real worker schedule from `OperationalDataManager`
- **Line 1454**: Loads contextual tasks from task service
- **Line 1470**: Combines routine tasks with regular assignments

### Schedule Integration
- **Line 1478-1532**: `loadScheduleWeek()` loads real weekly schedule
- **Line 1484**: Uses `container.operationalData.getWorkerWeeklySchedule`
- **Line 1487-1522**: Groups schedule items by date with proper formatting

### Real-World Data Sources
```swift
// Worker routine schedules from operational data
let workerScheduleItems = try await OperationalDataManager.shared.getWorkerScheduleForDate(workerId: workerId, date: Date())

// Contextual tasks from service container
let contextualTasks = try await container.tasks.getTasks(for: workerId, date: Date())

// Combined real data: routineTasks + regularTasks
```
