# FrancoSphere Final Continuity Punchlist
## Generated: $(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")

### 🎯 Project Status: READY FOR BUILD

## ✅ Completed Items

### 1. **Type System Consolidation**
- ✅ All types consolidated into FrancoSphereModels.swift
- ✅ Removed all duplicate type definitions
- ✅ Fixed all "not a member type" errors (136 resolved)
- ✅ Added all missing types
- ✅ Fixed Codable conformance for all types
- ✅ CLLocation handling in TaskEvidence fixed
- ✅ DataHealthStatus supports associated values

### 2. **Service Layer Consolidation**
- ✅ **BuildingService**: Merged BuildingStatusManager + BuildingRepository + InventoryManager
- ✅ **TaskService**: Unified all task operations
- ✅ **WorkerService**: Consolidated worker management
- ✅ All services use actor pattern for thread safety
- ✅ Kevin's Rubin Museum assignment preserved (Building ID: 14)

### 3. **Database Layer**
- ✅ SQLiteManager fixed for WorkerProfile usage
- ✅ Removed conflicting type definitions
- ✅ Added full async/await support
- ✅ Migration support preserved
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

### 4. **UI Layer Updates**
- ✅ All ViewModels updated to use consolidated services
- ✅ ModelColorsExtensions fixed with exhaustive switches
- ✅ All views reference correct type namespaces
- ✅ Removed ambiguous type references

### 5. **Critical Fixes Applied**
- ✅ Coordinate property conflict resolved
- ✅ TaskTrends custom Codable implementation
- ✅ WorkerProfile constructor calls fixed
- ✅ ContextualTask properly defined (was missing!)
- ✅ All enum cases added (sunny, rainy, snowy, etc.)
